## Reset Checkboxes Plugin

This is a basic plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that adds two commands:  one for checking all checkboxes in the active file, and one for *un*checking all checkboxes in the active file.

This project is based on the [Obsidian Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).
